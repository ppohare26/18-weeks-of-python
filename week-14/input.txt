              CONSTIPATION AND ITS CORRECTION BY EXERCISE\
\
\
Constipation or dyskinesia is one of the important influences in making\
people old before their time. The breaking down of the faculties and\
functions supposed to be due to old age is in reality due to the\
accumulation of waste and bacteria in the intestines. A habit of life\
which keeps the bowels clean will set \'93old age\'94 back to the time when\
men will enjoy perfect health to the utmost limit of a normal span of\
years (at the present time the normal span is fifty-eight years).\
\
There are many people who think they are quite normal, though they\
never had a regular daily movement of the bowels without the aid of\
laxatives in years. Yet, these same persons will not let the gasoline\
line on their automobile stay clogged one day.\
\
The body is a very delicate organism and it must be taken care of in\
a thoughtful fashion. A poisoned night is spent if a day is missed\
without a bowel movement, for the body cannot carry waste a great\
length of time without serious injury to it. Under a normal life the\
bowels should move at least once a day without artificial aid.\
\
\
_Results of Constipation_\
\
When food remains too long in the body it decays, putrefies, and\
develops into very active poisons. With this decaying comes a\
depressing feeling caused by these wastes being absorbed into the\
blood. Then, to make matters worse, this putrification retards the\
bowel action, thus keeping the poisons in the body. Thus, constipation\
results. Some of these poisons are not so harmful, yet others are very\
capable of infecting the body, and these enter the blood stream via\
the intestines and reach other organs where they may cause a chronic\
disease.\
\
Constipation brings many other ills besides that of poisoning and\
infecting the body. If this decay occurs too frequently, very serious\
infections may develop. Frequently diseases associated with old age,\
such as rheumatism, kidney trouble, and disturbances of the gall\
bladder are the result of a constipated condition which has run for\
years. The retained masses of putrefied food in the digestive tract\
many times displaces and distends the bowels with the ultimate result\
that it reacts on the nervous system and the circulation of the\
liver, and causes much suffering. Appendicitis is often traced to the\
continuous constipated condition.\
\
Other results of constipation can be dizziness, offensive breath,\
headache, loss of pep and vitality, bad temper, poor complexion,\
stomach disorders, skin eruptions, sleepless nights, loss of appetite,\
stupor, and piles.\
\
\
\
\
                        CAUSES OF CONSTIPATION\
\
\
_Lack of Exercise_\
\
One who leads an inactive life must expect to have a flabby body.\
Lack of exercise lowers the tone of the whole body and especially the\
abdominal viscera. This is an unhealthy way to live, for it offers no\
incentive to the stomach and intestines for the vigorous digestion of\
food. A good workout daily will stimulate and tone the intestines for\
better functioning.\
\
Unless your work involves a great deal of outdoor walking, a daily\
walk cannot be over-estimated in the treatment of constipation. Learn\
to stride along with the head and chest up, breathing deeply. Walking\
in this fashion will do as much good the last ten minutes as the\
first ten. This exercise will stimulate the appetite and increase the\
physical and mental tone of the body. It is a life-enriching as well\
as life-purifying habit.\
\
Learn to take a few workouts in the gym every week, that is, if you are\
physically able. However, before you plan your workout have your health\
doctor plan your program and limitations and what it should include.\
\
In the back of the book will be found exercises that will aid in\
the correction of constipation. These exercises will be found very\
beneficial if used daily.\
\
\
_Improper Diet_\
\
One of the chief causes of constipation is improper diet. Correct\
feeding alone may cure constipation. Even this rule has its exception,\
for there is a form of constipation associated with proper diet. This\
brings out the point that it is essential to have a health examination\
frequently by your family doctor, for he will give you correct\
knowledge of the condition of your body immediately.\
\
Before taking up the matter of food, it must be remembered that the\
purpose of this book is to give exercises to cure constipation and not\
to plan a diet. Your doctor will give you a correct diet. However, it\
is essential that the food should be chewed until it is almost a pulp\
before swallowing. This will aid the stomach and whole digestive tract\
in assimilating the food.\
\
The spirit of happiness and cheerfulness is important when eating. It\
cannot be over-emphasized. In fact, laughter during the meal time is\
very good for the digestive tract in digesting the food. This buoyancy\
of the mind will aid a great deal in the correction of constipation. It\
is the only exercise that can be used successfully while eating. Do not\
be downcast while eating, as this will prevent normal digestion.\
\
The typical breakfast is usually orange juice, eggs, toast or rolls\
and coffee. This breakfast will satisfy hunger and supply energy, but\
it does not meet the demands of health. It is true that this breakfast\
includes the necessary nutriments, but it does not contain bulk or\
roughage, which are sometimes desirable in order to give the bowels\
something to work upon.\
\
In order to give the body foods with roughage bran may be used in\
moderation. However, bran does not agree with everyone. The indulgence\
in this food should depend upon the advice of your physician.\
\
Fruit will cure constipation quicker than any constipation remedies\
ever advertised. Oranges, orange juice, figs, dates, and prunes\
are very good for the prevention as well as the correction of\
constipation. It is a very excellent idea to have some form of fruit\
for every meal. It cannot be over-emphasized.\
\
Vegetables are an absolute necessity in everyone\'92s diet. Nature gives\
us food values that cannot be estimated in importance. They clean the\
interior of the body and act as a broom in the digestive tract, that\
is, if they are eaten twice a day. They are a mechanical necessity\
to the intestines. Their bulk is absolutely needed to stimulate the\
intestines to activity.\
\
Foods which contain no mechanical stimulation such as pur\'e9es and\
gruel are open to objection. Pastries are very constipating due to\
the pasty element, for the secretions of the digestive tract cannot\
assimilate them. The psychic effect of a monotonous diet may cause\
poor digestion resulting in constipation. Such foods as eggs, milk,\
cheese--particularly cottage, pot smearcase and cream, white rice, tea,\
chocolate are said to be constipating because they seem to slow up the\
action of the intestinal tract.\
\
On the whole, eat foods that originally gave the human race its vigor,\
and you will get all the food values, the sunshine, and fresh air,\
which that food has absorbed during the days of its growth.\
\
\
_Laxatives_\
\
Laxatives do not cure constipation. They may serve to make it chronic.\
Yet one fourth of the people use them regularly. They only give\
artificial stimulation to the bowel movements. Every laxative, no\
matter how innocent in itself, is a habit forming drug for the bowels.\
They lash the bowel into action once or twice or a few times. After\
that the bowels will refuse to work without a laxative administered.\
The dose becomes larger and larger until heroic doses are consumed. NO\
LAXATIVE OR ANY FORM OF BOWEL WASHING SHOULD BE TAKEN UNLESS ADVISED BY\
A PHYSICIAN.\
\
\
_Posture_\
\
Poor posture ranks on a par with lack of exercise and improper diet in\
the cause of constipation. Poor posture aids in the slipping of the\
abdominal organs out of their respective places, resulting in a tangled\
mass which will act as an interference on the normal bowel action. As\
a general rule, poor posture hinders deep breathing. Thus, there is no\
compressing movement upon the organs of the abdominal regions, such as\
is found in a normal upright person. Deep, vigorous breathing is an aid\
to a normal bowel movement. Good posture is an absolute necessity for\
the freedom of the bowel acting.\
\
\
_During Defecation_\
\
Faulty posture during defecation causes insufficient emptying or\
difficulty in moving the bowels at all. Many closet seats are too high.\
The proper altitude is one that brings the knees a little higher than\
the posterior.\
\
A high closet seat can be remedied by using a footstool to support the\
feet, thus bringing the body into proper posture.\
\
\
_Hurried Defecation_\
\
A normal defecation ordinarily takes about two to three minutes, but\
owing to the abuse of resisting the call, ordinary defecation is not\
always secured in the normal time. Thus residue is left in the large\
intestine. This offers difficulty when a call comes some later hour,\
for the residue becomes hard and dry. This residue in the colon results\
in the condition known as\
\
\
_Irregularity in Answering Call_\
\
Irregularity in answering nature\'92s call causes irregularity of bowel\
action. Nature\'92s call means that enough waste is in the colon to cause\
automatic processes to set in action the bowel movement.\
\
If for any reason the bowels are not permitted to move at once, the\
call usually disappears in a few minutes and may not reappear for some\
time. Thus, the wastes lie in the colon with the water in them being\
absorbed by the intestine, causing the wastes to become dry. Due to\
these wastes remaining in the intestine distention is produced in\
the colon and defecation may become difficult or impossible without\
mechanical aid.\
\
The water of the waste which is absorbed into the blood stream affects\
the body, causing lower vitality and fatigue affecting the nerves.\
\
\
_Treatment_\
\
Hygiene is an important factor in restoring the body to a condition\
of health. The various abuses of the body that make for constipation\
should be corrected. General habits, and especially that of neglecting\
nature\'92s call, should be corrected. Without good hygiene the treatment\
of constipation cannot be successful.\
\
\
_Proper Diet_\
\
See your doctor and have him make out a proper diet. However, the diet\
should contain a sufficient amount of roughage, such as vegetables,\
fruits, and bran. Milk should be used for its vitamin qualities and\
nourishment.\
\
\
_Rules for Proper Eating_\
\
1. Do not eat too much.\
\
2. Do not study your food while eating.\
\
3. Enjoy what you eat.\
\
4. Chew your food until it swallows itself.\
\
5. Eat regularly.\
\
6. Do not eat when tired.\
\
7. Take a brisk short walk after eating, as this is an aid to the\
digestive processes.\
\
\
_Laxatives and Enemas_\
\
These should be used only upon the consent of your doctor. They do not\
cure, and if possible should be avoided.\
\
\
_Mental Attitude_\
\
Patience is necessary, and the feeling \'93I can\'92t\'94 should be changed to\
\'93I will.\'94 This feeling can do more than drugs. Do not hurry defecation.\
\
\
_Regularity_\
\
Visit the toilet at least once a day--not to read but to move the\
bowels. Aim to establish a habit by visiting the toilet the same time\
every day.\
\
\
_Use of Water_\
\
Most people drink too little water. Six glasses of water a day is the\
minimum and eight are better. Even more should be taken in hot weather.\
Avoid ice water, for it chills the stomach. If ice water is the only\
water available, sip it slowly.\
\
Water should be taken freely between meals. A glass at each meal will\
help digestion, and there is nothing that so helps the bowels as a\
glass or two of water before retiring.\
\
\
_Bathing_\
\
After taking the exercises described in the back of the book a bath\
should be taken. Take a shower or tub bath for two minutes with the\
temperature between 95\'b0 and 100\'b0 F. for cleansing purposes. This should\
be followed by a quick cold rub over the entire body. Dry with a rough\
towel until the skin glows. This should be followed by a cold wet towel\
rubbed on the abdomen for a few minutes until it attains a reddish\
glow. Then dry the body thoroughly, dress quickly, and you will have a\
keen appetite for the morning meal.\
\
\
_Exercises_\
\
The effectiveness of certain exercises in overcoming constipation has\
been scientifically proved. Diet alone will not cure constipation. Diet\
and exercise should be used together, and the victim of constipation\
should not neglect either. Suitable diet and proper exercises can\
usually be relied upon to cure the most obstinate case of constipation.\
They will very frequently banish that tired feeling and make one tingle\
with energy and vitality.\
\
Every one needs exercise other than his work, for work tires the same\
old muscles and the same old back day after day, while it neglects the\
vital muscles around the waist. Work wearies, while exercise refreshes.\
Exercise builds up the muscular system and makes work easier. Exercise\
may be harmful if too vigorous, and if the patient is not accustomed\
to it. These exercises as described below should be indulged in mildly\
at first, and as the body becomes accustomed to exercise increase the\
dosage.\
\
Monotony in doing the same old exercise cannot be condemned too\
vigorously. It is better to spread the dosage of work around the\
different parts of the body rather than to concentrate too vigorously\
on the muscles of the waist. The continuous repetition of certain\
movements results in fatigue, which causes atonic conditions about the\
parts involved.\
\
Regular exercises in the open air and getting the abdominal muscles\
and organs in first rate condition is the first step in securing\
longevity of life and renewed vitality. This will increase the appetite\
and strengthen the voluntary muscles of defecation. Vigorous exercise\
diverts the thoughts from business and household cares and relieves\
an important factor in constipation. Hill climbing, walking, running,\
horseback riding, and all forms of games are the best forms of exercise\
for the cure of constipation. It so happens in many cases that the\
individual is not physically fit for such activities, and then the\
following exercises cannot be used to advantage until the patient is\
able to participate in recreative exercises and games.\
\
In the following exercises that of raising both legs to a right angle\
from the lying position is purposely omitted because of the severe\
action on the abdomen and the paralyzing effect on the sensitive\
nervous systems of that region. Often an exaggerated condition of\
constipation comes from this type of exercise.\
\
In the following exercises it must be remembered that good posture is\
necessary for the proper effect on the vital organs.\
\
\
      EXERCISES FOR THE PREVENTION AND CORRECTION OF CONSTIPATION\
\
\
EXERCISE 1\
\
_Position_: Lying on back on floor, hands on sides, legs straight.\

be impossible to touch the heel, but stretch down as far as possible.\
In returning to the normal erect position, bring the hand out and up.\
\
\
EXERCISE 17\
\
_Position_: Lie on the back in form of a cross with arms extended.\
\
_Action_: Carry right foot up to the left until it touches the left\

EXERCISE 20\
\
_Position_: Body erect, chest up, feet apart.\
\
_Action_: Turn head and shoulders to right as far as possible. Then\
swing arms, head and shoulders in the opposite direction.\
\
_Remarks_: Waist muscles should be as lax and lifeless as possible. Let\
them twine around the body as if tied to the body with strings. This\
should be a daily exercise and can be used by people of all ages. It is\
very beneficial.\
\
\
EXERCISE 21\
\
_Position_: Stand erect with hands on hips.\
\
_Action_: Bend right and reach towards floor or ground. Reverse\
movement to left.\
\
_Remarks_: In reaching towards floor bring the hand only to the knee\
at first and then with each successive stretch bend a little lower\
until ground is reached. This exercise is very helpful in preventing or\
curing constipation and torpid liver.\
\
\
EXERCISE 22\
\
_Position_: Stand erect, hands on hips, feet apart.\
\
_Action_: Swing hips as far to right as possible then to left. Keep\
head as nearly as possible in starting position.\
\
_Remarks_: Hold hips a second or two in each position: _i. e._, right\
or left.\
\
\
EXERCISE 23\
\
_Position_: Body erect, hands on hips.\
\
_Action_: Bend forward very slowly, hinging only at hips, while keeping\
back straight and face to front. Bend low enough so that back is\
parallel to floor. Return to normal position slowly.\
\
_Remarks_: You will not like this exercise at first, but it is a very\
helpful exercise. Repeat exercise three to five times.\
\
\
EXERCISE 24\
\
_Position_: Stand erect with hands high above the head.\
\
_Action_: Bend to right and bring hands to floor near the right foot,\
going down slowly. Reverse movement and swing hands directly over head\

breathing with this exercise; exhale as you bend in one direction and\
inhale as you reverse movement.\
\
\
EXERCISE 25\
\
_Position_: Stand erect with hands on hips, feet together.\
\
_Action_: Bend forward until back and legs are at right angles. Turn\
right by pivoting at waist and swing head and shoulders around in\
a large circle until they have been returned to starting position.\
Reverse movement and swing around in opposite direction.\
\
_Remarks_: Keep knees straight. Do not bend too far backwards.\
This is a very strenuous but very effective waist strengthener and\
liver stimulating exercise. (Do not use until you are accustomed to\
exercising.)\
\
\
EXERCISE 26\
\
_Position_: Stand erect.\
\
_Action_: Take a full breath, hold it, reach out right and left, close\
fists tightly and tense arms. Repeat two or three times. Now take\
another deep breath and reach as far as you can with the feet while\
tensing the muscles of the legs.\
\
_Remarks_: This is an excellent exercise in beginning the morning\
workout.\
\
\
EXERCISE 27\
\
_Position_: Lying on back very lax and lifeless.\
\
_Action_: Take a full, deep breath very smoothly through the nostrils\
and at the same time expand the abdominal muscles as much as possible.\
Hold breath a few seconds, relax waist and abdominal muscles very\
slowly and then draw in and upward and exhale. Repeat five to ten times\
or oftener.\
\
_Remarks_: One of the best exercises a frail, weak person can take and\
quite as valuable for strong folk.\
\
\
EXERCISE 28\
\
_Position_: Stand erect, arms on level with shoulders.\
\
_Action_: Swing right foot around to a position two feet from left\
side of left foot thus twisting the legs. At the same time swing head\
and shoulders as far around to right as possible while keep the arms\
straight and in line with each other. Reverse and swing as far as\
possible to the left.\
\
_Remarks_: Repeat exercise eight to sixteen times. This is a good\
exercise to strengthen and make flexible a good many muscles of the\
body.\
\
\
EXERCISE 29\
\
_Position_: Stand erect, hands on hips.\
\
_Action_: Right foot raised backward, bend forward until back and legs\
are at right angles, exhale. Return to normal position. Repeat exercise\
four times to both sides.\
\
\
EXERCISE 30\
\
_Position_: Stand erect with chest up, chin in.\
\
_Action_: Expand chest and abdominal muscles suddenly while bringing\
hands up quickly above head at the same time taking a deep breath just\
as quickly as possible through the nostrils. Hold breath a few seconds\
then exhale very slowly as you lower hands to starting points. Repeat\
three to five times. Now take breath very slowly while bringing arms\
up laterally till hands meet above head. Bring arms back to sides very\
quickly and suddenly exhale completely through mouth. Repeat three to\
five times.\
\
_Remarks_: Another part can be added to the above exercise by taking a\
deep breath and counting fifty without taking more breath.\
\
The above exercises should be indulged in as you arise in the morning.\
They will give you pep and vitality that is needed to carry on a\
successful day. They will give the abdominal organs the workout that\
will prevent and correct constipation.\
\
These exercises are in reality liver regulators. You will undoubtedly\
discover after doing these exercises that you feel better in every way.\
\
It is essential to take several deep, long breaths between each\
exercise. Do not do the same exercises every morning. Pick out five and\
do them vigorously for fifteen minutes. There are enough exercises for\
six days of the week; thus you will not become tired of the monotony of\
exercises.\

free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg\'99\
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the\

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed\
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg\'99 trademark, but he has\
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project\
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid\
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are\

        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he\
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg\'99\
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all\
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue\
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg\'99\
        works.\
    \

the Project Gutenberg\'99 trademark. Contact the Foundation as set\
forth in Section 3 below.\
\
1.F.\
\
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable\
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread\
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project\
Gutenberg\'99 collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg\'99\
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may\
contain \'93Defects,\'94 such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate\
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other\
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or\
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or\
cannot be read by your equipment.\
\
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the \'93Right\
of Replacement or Refund\'94 described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project\
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project\
Gutenberg\'99 trademark, and any other party distributing a Project\
Gutenberg\'99 electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all\
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal\
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT\
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE\
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE\
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE\
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR\
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\
DAMAGE.\
\
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a\
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can\
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a\
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you\
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium\
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you\
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in\
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person\
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second\
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If\
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing\
without further opportunities to fix the problem.\
\
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth\
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you \'91AS-IS\'92, WITH NO\
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT\
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.\

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of\
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement\
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the\
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or\
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or\
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the\
remaining provisions.\
\
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the\
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone\
providing copies of Project Gutenberg\'99 electronic works in\
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the\
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg\'99\
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,\
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of\
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this\
or any Project Gutenberg\'99 work, (b) alteration, modification, or\
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg\'99 work, and (c) any\
Defect you cause.\
\
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\'99\
\
Project Gutenberg\'99 is synonymous with the free distribution of\
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\
from people in all walks of life.\
\
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\'99\'92s\
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\'99 collection will\
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg\'99 and future\
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\
\
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\
\
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\
Revenue Service. The Foundation\'92s EIN or federal tax identification\
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\
U.S. federal laws and your state\'92s laws.\
\
The Foundation\'92s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation\'92s website\
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\
\
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\
Literary Archive Foundation\
\
Project Gutenberg\'99 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\
public support and donations to carry out its mission of\
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\
status with the IRS.\
\
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\
\
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\
approach us with offers to donate.\
\
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\
\
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\
\
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\'99 electronic works\
\
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\
Gutenberg\'99 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\
distributed Project Gutenberg\'99 eBooks with only a loose network of\
volunteer support.\
\
Project Gutenberg\'99 eBooks are often created from several printed\
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\
edition.\
\
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search\
facility: www.gutenberg.org.\
\
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg\'99,\
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\
